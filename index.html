 			Sweaters for Penguins was a project originated with the Phillip Island Nature Park oil spill of January 2000 where 438 little penguins were affected.  

 			<p>When an oil spill happens, the affects on the wildlife around is devestating.  An oil spill the size of a thumbnail can kill a small penguin.  Often oiled penguins die from exposure and starvation.  Oil separates and mats their feather, allowing water to get in, which makes a penguin's body temperature drop, making them less able to hunt for food.</p>

 			Penguin sweaters help prevent penguins from preening and swallowing the toxic oil before they can be cleaned by the staff at the wildlife clinic.  	Sweaters aren't just for people or even dogs anymore - Penguins are in need of sweaters now more than ever.  Please donate your knits to us.  We have provided a link for the pattern for free.
